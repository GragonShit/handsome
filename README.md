- OpenCV

#### How to Run

1. c++11 surpported compilier is required.
2. I make a successful compile on **ubuntu 16.04** and **mac os-X 10.10**. Windows should be OK.
3. under model directory, there is a face landmarker, a eye landmarker and a eye-status classfier.

	```
	cd eye-rec/cpp
	mkdir build
	cmake ..
	make
	./demo
